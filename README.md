# Netflix Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of Netflix's dataset, implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis explores the Netflix dataset, providing insights into content types, genres, release trends, and more. Additionally, it includes advanced machine learning techniques like clustering and recommendation algorithms to better understand and predict user preferences.

## Features
Data Exploration

Null Value Analysis: Identifies and handles missing values in critical fields.
Content Type Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of movies and TV shows.
Release Trends: Analyzes the number of releases over time.
Data Visualization
Bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms for visualizing:
Content distribution by type, country, and genre.
Duration of movies and seasons of TV shows.
Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
Clustering Genres: Groups content into clusters based on genres using KMeans.
Dimensionality Reduction: Uses PCA and t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional genre data in 2D.
Recommendation System
Implements a content-based recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
Returns top recommendations for a given title.

Libraries Used

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
plotly

## How to Use

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-data-analysis.git
cd netflix-data-analysis

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open Netflix.ipynb:

jupyter notebook Netflix.ipynb

Load the Dataset:
Ensure the Netflix dataset (netflix_titles.csv) is in the same directory as the notebook. If not, place it there or adjust the file path in the notebook.

Explore the Analysis:
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to explore the insights and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is Netflix Movies and TV Shows from Kaggle. It includes the following columns:

Title

Type (Movie/TV Show)

Description

Genre

Director

Cast

Country

Release Year

Duration

Rating

Key Visualizations

Distribution of Content Types: Bar chart comparing counts of movies and TV shows.

Genre Clusters: Visualizes genres grouped by clusters using PCA and t-SNE.

Content Ratings by Country: Heatmap showing the distribution of ratings across countries.

Trend of Releases Over Time: Line chart analyzing the release trend of Netflix content over the years.

Recommendation System

The project includes a recommendation system based on content similarity.

How to Use: Enter a title, and the system returns the top 10 most similar titles based on the combined features of cast, genre, and description.
